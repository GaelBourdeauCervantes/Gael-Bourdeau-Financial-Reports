                    Hello, my passion for finance, specifically focused on fundamental analysis, has taken me on an exciting journey of learning. Inspired by iconic figures like Benjamin Graham, Peter Lynch, and Warren Buffett, I've dedicated time to learn fundamental analysis. Through this learning, I've developed a deep love for unraveling the secrets behind investments. On this site, my goal is to share my enthusiasm and knowledge by publishing detailed reports of the stock analyses I conduct. I hope you find these financial analyses I share useful and enriching!

                        <p class="summary">Based on the analysis, América Móvil (AMX) appears to be facing challenges, including limited growth, high debt levels, and intense competition. While some valuation metrics suggest the stock is trading at a fair value, others indicate overvaluation. The company's weak financial strength and limited profitability are concerning. Investors should carefully consider their investment objectives and risk tolerance before buying América Móvil stock. I will personally not recommend to buy the stock, the business does not seem healthy, and the valuation is not that cheap for compensating the risks.

                        <p>Bachoco, a leading player in Mexico's poultry industry, exhibits both strengths and potential challenges. The company boasts solid financials, a robust balance sheet, and remarkable financial strength. It consistently delivers returns on equity and assets, with an impressive ROIC that exceeds its cost of capital. However, Bachoco faces risks related to international trade policies, the cyclical nature of the poultry industry, and concentrated ownership. The recent delisting from the NYSE introduces uncertainties in international market accessibility. It could be a worthwhile investment, but it may be a good idea to wait to the calculated intrinsic values range from $53.27 to $75.72, suggesting a potential yield between -26.93% and +3.87%. </p>
